  "History": "Champions of Khazad is a World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic guild on the EU realm Earthshaker. It was founded in World of Warcraft Classic on the 5th of March 2021 on the EU realm Dragonfang by Caszhar as a part of the huge \"reroll\" event called The Fresh Crusade, also started by Caszhar. Initially created as a guild for Dwarves and Gnomes only, it subsequently merged with another guild, after which all Alliance races were permitted to join. The previous members of the guild that merged with Champions of Khazad left after Vick, a rogue from the original Champions of Khazad roster, rolled on Warblade of the Hakkari, complaining that it was best in slot for a hunter from their guild who had soft reserved a mount instead. The guild only undertook casual raiding in World of Warcraft Classic, but began to raid more seriously in The Burning Crusade Classic, going on to kill every boss while it was current content, with the exceptions of Lady Vashj and Kael'thas Sunstrider. During the pre-patch for The Burning Crusade Classic, the population of Dragonfang declined, and the guild moved to the EU realm Zandalar Tribe. During The Burning Crusade Classic, Caszhar, the Guild Master, quit raiding and Wooper became a full time kindergarten teacher. It was decided that a long-standing rogue member of the guild would receive the Warglaives of Azzinoth, but he failed to get attuned to Black Temple and eventually quit. At the end of The Burning Crusade Classic, while the guild was raiding Sunwell Plateau, Zandalar Tribe's population also declined, prompting the guild to move once again, this time to the EU realm Earthshaker. The guild has continued to raid throughout Wrath of the Lich King Classic. The guild has a Loot Council loot system, whose members are often accused of rigging who gets which item by yelling \"rigd\" whenever an item is awarded to a Loot Council member.",
  "Rules": [
    "1. Treat your companions the way you want to be treated. No matter how drunk a Dwarf and Gnome may be, we must stick together!",

    "3. No hate speech or personal attacks.",
    "4. No explicit content: porn, gore, etc.",

    "6. Have fun! It's what we're all here for, so let's hunt some orc!"

  "Terms": {
    "Glizzy": "Alternative term for a hot dog or a Glock: \"Pops wasting no time to throat the glizzy... he a real glizzy gladiator\". Short for Glizabeth.",
    "Chesand": "Chesand is a term that has been used by members to express frustration, confusion, or simply as a form of comedic exaggeration. It's a playful way for guild members to vent or poke fun at certain situations. It has become a unique part of our guild's culture and inside jokes. Once upon a raid in the hallowed halls of Icecrown Citadel, Carris, the esteemed Restoration Druid, led the Champions of Khazad into battle against the Lich King. As the raid descended into chaos, with spells flying and enemies falling, Carris found herself in a precarious situation. Surrounded by enemies, she exclaimed, \"Chesand!\" The guild was taken aback, momentarily confused by the new word. But Carris, ever resourceful, rallied the team with her unyielding determination. Inspired by her battle cry, the raid fought fiercely, and in the end, emerged victorious. \"Chesand!\" became a rallying cry for the guild, a symbol of Carris' resilience and the triumph of the Champions of Khazad. And so, the tale of Carris and her legendary cry of \"Chesand!\" became a legend in the annals of the guild."
